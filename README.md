## My process

### What I learned
I mainly learned working with `.forEach()` and `.filter()`. It's the first time I used `.splice()` in a working app.

→ code refactoring: there are some errors in the html/css that need to be cleaned up. Also the JS can be written more concise.

### Stretch Goals

→ change the theme

→ offer a 'meal deal' discount

→ allow users to rate their experience
